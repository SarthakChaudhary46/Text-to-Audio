# Text-to-Audio
This Python script allows you to convert any text into speech and save it as an MP3 file. You can input a multi-line story or text, and the program will automatically generate an MP3 file with the spoken version of the text. It also supports automatic playback depending on your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
